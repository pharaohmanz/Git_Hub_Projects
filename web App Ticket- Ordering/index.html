<p>  Assignment 1 is designed to get us familiar with the web creation process. This project was divided in parts that would focus on several main points. First, we needed to be able to understand how Folder structures are organized to contain all of the files that make up a site. Secondly, as web developers it is important that developers know key elements involved in making a site work as fluidly and cohesively as possible. Through the use of tutorials we were able to learn some advanced HTML that allowed us to achieve our goals of making our portfolio appear as professional as possible and also allow users to interact with the site in various ways. The final requirement was for us to be able to integrate all these aspects of formatting and style of the portfolio through the use of CSS( cascading style sheet).</p>

<p>  In this assignment I was introduced to HTML and modern web development for the first time so it was quite a new experience. However, since I do have programming experience it was fairly, easy to go through the tutorials and get a feel for how HTML worked overall. I was pleasantly surprised that I could declare classes, and formatting types similar to how we create classes in java and other languages. Combining the knowledge of how html tags worked and CSS is what was conceptually somewhat difficult for me to understand, but still very interesting for me. </p>

<p><a href="./Project2/index.html">Assignment 2</a> </p>


<p> Assignment 2 was a very enjoyable assignment that made us familiar with the process of client server processing of inputs on  a website. Like the first
assignment we were required to include minimal requirements such as a text box, radio buttons, check boxes,a drop down , and some action buttons
.One thing I found somewhat challenging was implementing input validation so that the user could be prompted when they input invalid information. In the real world this is very important 
because there can be so many issues with the functionality of a site if the information isnt accepted correctly.In the later half of the assignment we were required to implement functions similar to those
done in modern programming languages. I found it refreshing to have both function ability and the if-then control structure in creating this site. 
 .In the end we were required to represent our progam through the use of a structured flow chart.Although I had never used Visio before I had previous experience with a program called SFC(Structured Flow Chart Editor)
 which has much of the same functionality.</p> 


<h3 style="text-align:Left;" <i> Objectives: </i>  </h4>
<ul style="list-style-type:square"  >
  <li>Create a web form using HTML Tags</li>
  <li>Implement Input validation on web forms</li>
  <li>learn how to use functions and control structures for program execution </li>
  <li>Model control structured program through the use of flow charting software.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="./assign3/index.html">Assignment 3</a> </p>


<p> Assignment 3  emphasized the use java oriented programming through the use of functions and variables calls.Overall the main concept revolved around Input Processing and Output. 
Given a series of input we performed operations via our functions that allowed us to display statistics such as the mean, mode, standard deviation,and sample.The input part was fairly simple because 
of the variety of ways we could accept the data either sequentially or all at once using list box.However, Processing the data via each function required slightly more effort.The array data stucture is always
makes iterative  numeric computations very efficient.Also,The ability to re-use parts of some code in others is what ultimately makes the software design process so elegant .</p> 


<h3 style="text-align:Left;" <i> Objectives: </i>  </h5>
<ul style="list-style-type:square"  >
  <li>Create forms suitable for processing of numbers.</li>
  <li>Selection of Data structure suitable for selected task</li>
  <li>Using Java script files to serve as function libraries. </li>
  <li>Code re-use and efficiency </li>
  <li>Data testing /maintanence</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="./assign4/index.html">Assignment 4</a> </p>


<p> Assignment 4 allowed us to learn how to use HTML 5 in the creation of animation content on our website. There were various tools that 
allowed us to accomplish  different kinds of images and animations.Interestingly almost all implemnentations implent html5 canvas someway or another
in adding the animated content. The Drawings can be done a number of ways but I found it very intuitive to use Jquery and the animat() function in creating my animations.
I did attempt using gif images to help make the scene more animated but I wasn't able to control the length of time for which they ran. Finally, with the help
of several tutorials I was able to create and animation for Jacksonville beach themed post card. I've always wanted to send my family overseas and I think this would 
be an excellent way to give them a visual sample and feel.

<p><a href="./assign5/index.php">Assignment 5</a> </p>


<p> Assignment 5 was a very interesting assignment that us utilize the yahoo API for retreiving the stock quotes  and implementing them within our Portfolio Manager. I found quite a few things to be very different than I"m normaly
used to in PHP. It made sense to be able to embed it inside the html code and run the various scripts and sessions for storing persistent data. I would say that this was somewhat challenging because of my limited experience using
API's and pulling data in from other websites.Much of the core processing occured through text file processing and hard coding some information such as the user login and stocks once the user was prompted.</p> 


<h3 style="text-align:Left;" <i> Objectives: </i>  </h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square"  >
  <li>Create a web log in Manager with PHP</li>
  <li>Validate user Log in againts a text File</li>
  <li>Fetching data from an outside source and embedding it within our website </li>
  <li>Processing and modification  of text stored Records.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="./assign6/index.php">Assignment 6</a> </p>


<p> This assignment got us familiar with the process of creating a database driven website application which ran off mySQL and collected information provided by the user.
The first part of the assigment was fairly simple because it followed regular SQL  creations of a table. The second part was more involving allowing  us to learn 
various insert commands to query the database . I was surprised to see how the update commands worked because it required a sort of buffer that used select and where conditions
to specifiy which fields would change and which one would remain the same. Overall, this was a really informative and enjoyable assignment.


<h3 style="text-align:Left;" <i> Objectives: </i>  </h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square"  >
  <li>Create a Table in mySQL</li>
  <li>understand how to input records within database</li>
  <li>Removal and Modifaction of Records within database </li>
  <li>SQL Injection</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="./assign7/index.php">Assignment 7</a> </p>


<p> This assignment was an introduction for me to AJAX ( ASynchronous JavaScript and XML).The central idea behind the use of AJAX is that it allows for data exchange with the server 
and dynamically updating webpages without having to refresh. Almost all major websites use some form of AJAX and it proved very 
usefull in modifying my assignment 6. I was able to using AJAX create a function that called out to php and filtered through 
a SQL Query based on the Authors of my book Database. It seemed somewhat intuitive, but I did have some issues
with attempting other more advance queries. 


<h3 style="text-align:Left;" <i> Objectives: </i>  </h3>
<ul style="list-style-type:square"  >
  <li> Build upon assignment 6</li>
  <li>filter Data displayed </li>
  <li>learn about AJAX </li>
</ul>
